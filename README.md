# Herakles: The Game
Have you ever wanted to face the perilous challenges Herakles faces to prove himself worthy to the Greek Gods? Well, now you can! Created as a final project for CLA-101: Myth and Meaning (Fall 2022), navigate through 9 of the 12 labours Herakles faced in the style of Pok√©mon!

There are two ways to run the game. The first way is to download the executable build and run the application. The second way (and more preferred) is to download the python build and run the given Python file. Both builds run the same game; however, the Python build provides more images and a title screen.

## Known Issues
* After completing level 3 or 6, level 6 or 3 (respectively) will be unplayable, leaving the window white after entering the level. Please close and reopen the program to fix the issue.
